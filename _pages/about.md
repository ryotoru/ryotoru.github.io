Hi! I’m Himanshu, a research assistant working with [Dr. Pratyush Pranav](https://www.pratyushpranav.org/) at the [Trivedi School for Biosciences](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/trivedi-school-of-biosciences/). My current research focuses on cleaning and analyzing astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

**About Me:**

Over the past year, I’ve developed a deep interest in cryptography, especially in the realm of privacy-focused technologies. As a research assistant under [Dr. Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com/), I’ve been studying the role of lattices in post-quantum cryptography, with a focus on [Lattice-Based Zero-Knowledge Proofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/284) and the exciting overlaps between [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/981). These areas fascinate me because of their potential to enhance privacy and security in digital communication.

My curiosity extends beyond cryptography. I love to tinker with technology, which has led me to projects like reverse engineering car head units, designing RF jamming devices, and conducting security analysis for smart home devices. I've also been involved in projects aimed at enhancing the security of end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp, aligning with the IT Ministry of India’s guidelines on data protection.

When I’m not deep into research or tech projects, I enjoy reading manga, watching anime, and keeping up with the latest sneaker releases. I’m also passionate about cognitive sciences, particularly understanding how our brains perceive the world and how environments, especially those with violence, can affect memory.

If you’re interested in similar fields or looking for someone who enjoys diving into deep discussions about tech, cryptography, or cognitive science, feel free to reach out at [himaanshu216@gmail.com](mailto:himaanshu216@gmail.com). I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals!
