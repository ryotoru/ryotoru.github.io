**About Me**

HI! I am Himanshu, a pre-doctoral research assistant at the [Trivedi School of Biosciences](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/trivedi-school-of-biosciences/), working under the guidance of [Dr. Pratyush Pranav](https://www.pratyushpranav.org/). My research focuses on the application of topological data analysis, particularly [persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology), in conjunction with machine learning techniques to investigate complex systems across various domains.

My academic interests are centered on understanding the underlying structures and dynamics of complex systems, with a particular emphasis on biological systems through algebraic and computational perspectives. This  toolkit of a computational topology with ML allows me to explore diverse fields, including [astrophysics](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/4167/5364559), [neural dynamics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.761703/full), and  [mechanistic interpritability](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6oF6pRr2FgjTmiHus/topological-data-analysis-and-mechanistic-interpretability).

Previously, I have contributed to projects aimed at enhancing data privacy and security, such as developing end-to-end encryption protocols for secure communication and implementing privacy frameworks for data protection. I have also worked on tools for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), with a focus on their application in the healthcare sector.

Beyond my research, I have a keen interest in behavioral sciences, especially in understanding how early-life environments influence memory and decision-making processes. I am also intrigued by the role of social media in shaping public opinion and political discourse.

In my leisure time, I enjoy reading manga, binging sports highlights and TV shows at 1.5x or talking about impending climate doom.

Feel free to reach out to me at [my email](mailto:himaanshu216@gmail.com) if you are interested in discussing topics related to my research or potential collaborations.
